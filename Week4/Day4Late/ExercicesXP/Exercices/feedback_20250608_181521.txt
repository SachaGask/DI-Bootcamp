suggestions for improvement:
- The error messages in both `makeAllCaps` and `sortWords` could be more descriptive. For example, instead of 'Error: Not all elements are strings', it could say 'Error: The input array must contain only strings'. Similarly, 'Error: Array length is 4 or less' could be 'Error: The input array must contain more than 4 strings'.
- While the performance is good for these small examples, for very large arrays, consider using more efficient sorting algorithms than the default `sort()` method.  For extremely large datasets, explore libraries offering optimized sorting.
- Add comments explaining the purpose of each function and the logic within the promise handlers. This will enhance readability and maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code does not address the daily challenges. It contains examples of basic promise usage, but it doesn't implement the `makeAllCaps`, `sortWords`, `toJs`, `toMorse`, or `joinWords` functions as specified in the challenge.
- The code lacks the implementation of error handling and promise chaining required by the challenges. 
- The code should include user input handling (for the second challenge) and DOM manipulation (for displaying the Morse code translation).
