suggestions for improvement:
- The `get_words_from_file` function is missing and needs to be implemented to read the word list from the provided file.  The commented out code suggests the intention was there, but it's not functional.
- Error handling in `main` should be more robust. Instead of raising a `TypeError`, it should print a user-friendly error message and allow the user to retry input, or gracefully exit.
- The code lacks input validation for the file path in `get_words_from_file` (if implemented).  It should handle cases where the file doesn't exist or is inaccessible.
- Add comments to the JSON exercise explaining each step of the process and choice of data types.
- The `get_random_sentence` function could be improved by directly returning the capitalized string instead of using a temporary variable `phrase`. This would make the code more concise.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet only addresses Exercise 2.  Exercise 1 (random sentence generator) is missing entirely.
- Error handling is missing. The code should include `try-except` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` (in Exercise 1) and  `KeyError` (in Exercise 2).
- Input validation in Exercise 1 should be more robust.  It should check for non-integer input more thoroughly and potentially handle other unexpected input types.
- The solution for Exercise 2 uses a hardcoded date. The instructions suggest a user input or a more dynamic approach for setting the birth date.
- The code lacks a main function to tie together the different parts and enable the user to interact with the program.
