suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods should return '5 dollars' instead of '5 dollars'. The pluralization of the currency is inconsistent.  Consider adding logic to handle this consistently (e.g., if amount > 1 then pluralize).
- In Exercise 1, the addition of integers to Currency objects and in-place addition of integers should return Currency objects.  The current implementation returns a raw integer or float, which is inconsistent with the goal. It should return a new `Currency` object.
- Exercise 4, 5, and 6 are missing function definitions. Only the import statement and function call are present for Exercise 4 and 5. Exercise 6 only prints the result for a hardcoded date.
- Add docstrings to all functions to improve readability and understanding.
